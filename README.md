# MavenWeather - an application for displaying temperature and location based on IP address
MavenWeather is a simple app, which uses the user's IP address in order to obtain the current temperature in that location and the location itself, and automatically
opens a Google Maps tab with the user's location. The application is built with Java and Maven and threads. It uses APIs to obtain the above-mentined information.
When the app is started, it initiates a timer, which will update the location and tempature every single hour.
